        <p>I hope to gain <strong>development experience</strong> from <em>this course</em>. I've also always wondered how web pages were built because I have only ever known about building web pages with Squarespace. 
            This class will also <strong>broaden</strong> my coding abilities and also potentially open more <em>opportunities</em> in the future for my career. This course will also improve my skills using Git and GitHub from using repositories for submissions.</p>
